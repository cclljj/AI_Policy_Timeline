    "Description": "On January 23, 2025, an executive order titled 'Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence' was issued to bolster U.S. dominance in AI. This policy aims to eliminate regulatory obstacles that hinder AI innovation, emphasizing the development of AI systems free from ideological bias to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security. It mandates the creation of an AI action plan within 180 days, involving key offices such as the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto. The order also requires an immediate review of actions under the previous Executive Order 14110 (October 2023) and directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to revise specific memoranda within 60 days to align with this new policy. This executive action underscores a strategic shift toward deregulation, aiming to accelerate AI development while ensuring alignment with American values. It reflects the government's recognition of AI's critical role in maintaining economic and security advantages globally, though its long-term impact depends on the specifics of the action plan and subsequent implementations.",

    "Description": "The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released the AI Risk Management Framework (RMF) on January 26, 2023, as a voluntary tool to manage risks associated with AI. This framework guides organizations in incorporating trustworthiness into AI design, development, use, and evaluation, addressing risks to individuals, organizations, and society. Developed through a transparent, consensus-driven process with public input, the RMF aligns with other AI risk management efforts. It includes companion resources like the AI RMF Playbook, Roadmap, and Crosswalk, and is supported by the Trustworthy and Responsible AI Resource Center, launched in March 2023. A Generative AI Profile, released in July 2024, addresses specific risks of generative AI technologies. The RMF is pivotal for promoting ethical AI practices, offering practical guidance for organizations to mitigate potential harms while fostering innovation. Its voluntary nature encourages broad adoption across sectors, making it a cornerstone of responsible AI governance in the U.S.",
